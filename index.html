                Everyone wants to be an expert. But what does that even mean? Over the years I’ve seen two types of
                people who are referred to as “experts.” Expert 1 is someone who knows every tool in the language and
                makes sure to use every bit of it, whether it helps or not. Expert 2 also knows every piece of syntax,
                but they’re pickier about what they employ to solve problems, considering a number of factors, both
                code-related and not.

                This article will briefly explain what object relational mapping (ORM) is, what an ORM library is, and
                why you should consider using one with your next JavaScript project. We’ll also help you evaluate the
                best JavaScript and TypeScript ORM libraries based on your needs as a project developer and maintainer.
